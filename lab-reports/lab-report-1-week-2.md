# Lab Report 1

## Installing VScode
- First, I went to the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) website
- As shown in the image, I clicked the "Download for Windows" button (the dropdown menu shows more options for other operating systems)

- I then followed the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

## Remotely Connecting
- First, I had to find my course specific account name [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
- Then I clicked on "change your password" and followed the on-screen instructions. If you don't want to change your MyTritonLink password, you can, but I changed everything
- We also have to install [OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse), which I already have installed

- Now we are ready to remotely connect using VSCode
- Open a terminal in VSCode and type `ssh cs15lwi22ahx@ieng6.ucsd.edu`, replacing the `ahx` with your own account information
- Type your new password, and the following screen should appear

- I have already set a key, so I did not have to type a password in
